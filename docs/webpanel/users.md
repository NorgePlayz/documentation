description: How to authorize new users on your API
---


To add a new user to MCSS, open the software, click on `Web Panel > Manage Users & API Keys` 
You will find a button labeled "Add User". Click on this button to open the user management page.

Add a username and password then click "Add user" and your new user is configured.

:::caution No permission support
The API itself doesn't support permissions, so every user will have full access - That includes power actions, but more importantly console commands.
